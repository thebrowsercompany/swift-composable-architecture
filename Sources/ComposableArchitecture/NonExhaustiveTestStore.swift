          An effect returned for this action is still running. It must complete before the end of \
          the test. …

          To fix, inspect any effects the reducer returns for this action and ensure that all of \
          them complete by the end of the test. There are a few reasons why an effect may not have \
          completed:

          • If an effect uses a scheduler (via "receive(on:)", "delay", "debounce", etc.), make \
          sure that you wait enough time for the scheduler to perform the effect. If you are using \
          a test scheduler, advance the scheduler so that the effects may complete, or consider \
          using an immediate scheduler to immediately perform the effect instead.

          • If you are returning a long-living effect (timers, notifications, subjects, etc.), \
          then make sure those effects are torn down by marking the effect ".cancellable" and \
          returning a corresponding cancellation effect ("Effect.cancel") from another action, or, \
          if your effect is driven by a Combine subject, send it a completion.
